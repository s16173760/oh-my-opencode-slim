# Deepwork

Deepwork is an orchestrator workflow for heavy coding sessions. Use it when the
work is broad, risky, multi-file, or likely to span several implementation
phases. Do not use it for trivial edits, quick docs changes, or simple bug fixes.

## Core Contract

When deepwork is active, the orchestrator must manage the work as a scheduler,
not as the default implementation worker.

Required behavior:

- keep OpenCode todos aligned with the active deepwork phase;
- create and maintain a local markdown progress file under `.slim/deepwork/`;
- write valuable research findings into that file as confirmed research context
  when they are received and reconciled;
- draft a plan before implementation;
- ask `@oracle` to review the plan and revise it until acceptable;
- create a phased implementation/delegation plan;
- ask `@oracle` to review that implementation plan before execution;
- before oracle reviews, add relevant confirmed research findings and file
  references to the deepwork file so oracle can review the plan or phase from
  accepted context instead of redoing discovery;
- after oracle review and before each implementation phase, decide the execution
  path: what can run in parallel, what must be sequential, which specialists to
  delegate to, and whether to call the same agent multiple times for separate
  bounded lanes;
- execute phase by phase with specialist delegation where useful;
- after each phase, validate, update the deepwork file, ask `@oracle` to review
  the phase result, fix actionable issues, then continue;
- ask `@oracle` phase reviews to include simplify/readability feedback alongside
  correctness, blockers, risks, and plan adherence;
- finish with final validation and a concise summary.

## Deepwork File

Create a task-specific file such as:

```text
.slim/deepwork/<short-task-slug>.md
```

Keep `.slim/deepwork/` out of git, but make it readable to OpenCode. Ensure the
project ignore files include:

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.slim/deepwork/
```

```gitignore
# .ignore
!.slim/deepwork/
!.slim/deepwork/**
```

Do not follow a rigid template. Choose whatever markdown structure best fits the
work. The file only needs to remain useful as persistent session state and should
capture, as applicable:

- current goal and understanding;
- confirmed research context from `@librarian`, `@explorer`, docs, code reads,
  or external references, including source links/paths when available;
- assumptions, constraints, and decisions;
- plan drafts and oracle review notes;
- implementation phases and status;
- validation results;
- unresolved questions, blockers, and follow-ups.

Update this file after major decisions, valuable specialist research, reviews,
phase completions, validation results, and scope changes. When `@librarian`,
`@explorer`, docs, code reads, or external references produce useful information,
reconcile the result and record the accepted findings here so later planning and
reviews share the same context instead of rediscovering it.

## Scheduler Discipline

Use the V2 scheduler model throughout:

- dispatch `@explorer`, `@librarian`, `@fixer`, `@designer`, `@oracle`, or
  `@council` lanes as background tasks when useful;
- record task/session IDs and ownership boundaries;
- poll `task_status` before consuming background results;
- reconcile terminal results before dependent work;
- keep write scopes separate when parallelizing;
- do not advance to the next phase while relevant jobs are running or terminal
  results are unreconciled.

`@oracle` owns review and risk assessment. It should review plans and completed
phase outputs, not become the default implementer. For phase reviews, explicitly
ask oracle to use its simplify skill when available and report readability,
maintainability, and unnecessary-complexity findings separately from blocking
correctness issues.

## Lightweight Judgment

Deepwork is meant to prevent chaotic long sessions, not create paperwork. Keep
the markdown concise, batch small related checks when reasonable, and scale the
number of review gates to the risk of the work. If the task becomes small and
obvious, finish simply while preserving validation and the final summary.
